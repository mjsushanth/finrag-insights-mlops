# DuckDB Usage for finrag-insights-mlops

#### Course Project (MLOps IE7374)
#### Author: Joel Markapudi.

## Introduction
The data engineering content of this project involves using DuckDB, a high-performance analytical database, to perform stratified sampling, complete data cleaning, data validation suite, data export suite, various EDA tasks, and complex SQL logic implementations achieved across 30+ SQL files.

    qc_checks.sql            -- quick validations
    sampler.duckdb             -- the DB file DBeaver connects to

1. 01_macros_sampling.sql (define reusable “procs”) - Concepts such as Uniform (block) sampling to Parquet, Stratified sampling by (company, year). 
2. Other ideas for sampling: Deterministic hash-based sampling.


### Reproducibility considerations:

1. **Reproducibility by Design**: Full end-to-end reproducibility (71.8M raw corpus → 1M sample) requires 1.6GB source parquet (`sec_filings_large_full.parquet`) which cannot be hosted due to size constraints. However, we provide 6 exported dimension tables (<1MB total) and complete SQL scripts that enable full pipeline reproduction.
2. **Production Scripts are Fully Parameterized**: Core pipeline scripts, validation scripts, export scripts use session variable architecture with clear prerequisites documentation, enabling one-shot execution by modifying parameters.    
    - Do verify SQL Scripts such as, `31_run_n_company_table_creation, 31_run_stratified, 31_run_stratified_post_analysis, 32_1_NComp_21CompTable_Creation, 32_2_SectionName_DimensionCreation, etc.` 
3. **Ad-Hoc Engineering Non-Reproducible**: Data exploration, company curation with fuzzy matching (S&P 500 integration, CIK resolution), and iterative schema design represent one-time discovery work documented for transparency but not designed for automation.


### Setup & Prequisites:
1. Please install Dbeaver and DuckDB drivers.
2. Create a new connection in DBeaver using the DuckDB driver.
3. Please ensure imports are done on certain important tables, i.e., parquets from link: `https://northeastern-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/markapudi_j_northeastern_edu/EkC4TUt2LM1MnTTEETIrDOcB833o96I6HwTLtCE8j36TgQ?e=7JoEg4`  `necessary_data_exports/` folder.
4. The large table is hosted in Sharepoint to not bloat GitHub repo size. 
**Import Guide** (create these tables in `sampler.main` schema):
```sql
    CREATE TABLE dim_sec_sections AS SELECT * FROM read_parquet('finrag_dim_sec_sections.parquet');
    CREATE TABLE finrag_tgt_comps_75 AS SELECT * FROM read_parquet('finrag_dim_companies_75.parquet');
    -- (repeat for remaining tables..)
```


### Key Technical Achievements:
- **Data Integration Complexity**: Successfully merged 3 heterogeneous sources (Excel SPY holdings, SEC JSON mappings, 71.8M-row Parquet corpus) using fuzzy matching and manual curation. 
- **Advanced Sampling Logic**: Developed a production-grade stratified sampling pipeline in DuckDB SQL, implementing temporal weighting, section coverage guarantees, and ad-hoc feature engineering with regex-based flags.
- **Conditional Incremental Injection**: Implemented flag-based external data merging (e.g., GOOGL 2015-2019) with schema alignment validation, enabling selective integration of partner/API data without breaking existing pipeline.
- **Section Metadata Standardization**: Resolved encoding ambiguity between multiple sources (0-19 numeric codes) by creating canonical dimension table mapping to official SEC item structure.


### Features: Production-grade stratified sampling pipeline with DuckDB SQL.
- Integrated three heterogeneous sources: S&P 500 ETF holdings (Excel), SEC CIK mappings (JSON), and 71.8M-sentence corpus (Parquet).
- Implemented two-tier fuzzy matching, numerous ad-hoc data cleaning scripts, join analysis scripts, on-spot data validation queries.
- Achieved corpus coverage (539 matched from 700 targets) with documented missing companies justifications.
- Designed product-focused temporal weighting (A/B/C split across 2006-2009, 2010-2015, 2016-2020) based on user query patterns, with conditional injection of high-priority manual data. 
- Eliminated randomization risks: Guarantees complete section coverage (all 20 sections) for 2016-2020 period.
- Two-stage execution pattern: sampling (sentenceIDs only, 1.7s) followed by complete schema retrieval (36.8s join-back).
- Engineered 12 derived flags with word-boundary-protected regex patterns to minimize false positives. 
- Created reproducible, strong data preparation workflow using DuckDB SQL scripts.
- Completely parameterized execution, Session Variable Architecture, Environment-agnostic design present for `run_stratisfied.sql.`
- Clean separation: configuration (variables) → intermediate state (params table) → execution logic (sampling/join/export).
- Organized 15+ SQL scripts using numbered taxonomy (00_setup, 20_eda, 21_curation, 31_sampling, 90_qc) documenting iterative problem-solving. 
- Live system support: ETL-pattern audit columns for incremental load. (`last_modified_date, sample_version, source_file_path, load_method, etc.`)
- **Execution logging framework** tracks pipeline steps with row counts, messages, and sub-second timing precision for troubleshooting and performance analysis.
- Export to compressed Parquet (ZSTD) produces ~75MB artifact.
- Documented dataset coverage limitations (89 missing S&P 500 companies including Alphabet/Google) with root cause analysis. (Huggingface dataset has 71M rows but yet misses numerous companies.)

- 47s is excellent for a large 71M -> 1M workload with complex sampling logic.



### Limitations & Scope Boundaries
1. Connection to MotherDuck (serverless DuckDB), Dagster pipeline, Dbt - Airflow for database orchestration.
    - 1M dataset sample acts as a one-time data prep step for ML model training.
    - MotherDuck pricing, hosting raw dataset (per GB-hour for compute or storage cost) cant be justified for a 1-time sampling task.
    - DuckDB's file-based architecture enables full local development with production-grade performance.
2. Sample `finrag_sampling.py` is written to show Proof of Concept: AWS SageMaker Notebook, dag, SQL-wrapper for load and execute SQL concept ( `conn.execute(sql_script)` ). This is just a dummified workflow script.


### Grouping Idea For DuckDB Scripts:
1. A_bootstrap/, B_params/, C_macros/, D_jobs/, E_qc/.
2 Or, Numbering Scheme: 00_, 01_, 10_, 11_, 12_, qc_.sql, etc.
    00–09 · Session bootstrap
    10–19 · Reference / DDL 
    20–29 · EDA / inspection
    30–39 · Actions / jobs
    ...
    90–99 · QA / QC / audits


### Disclaimer on Unmatched Tickers:
- After extensive EDA query and excel-based double-checking, manual reviews, 89 companies out of the master list (for the historical fact table) have no name, ticker or any match in the 4675 distinct CIK-Company dimension, which comes from large data - 71 Million rows. 
- We attribute this lack of match to the huggingface dataset's limitations.
- Some of those companies include: Broadcom Inc., Alphabet Inc., BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO, BANK OF AMERICA CORP /DE/, WELLS FARGO & COMPANY/MN, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC, MORGAN STANLEY, AT&T INC.

### Budget Hours consideration for automated SQL-testing suite and learning:
- Decided to prioritize core sampling tasks and manual QC checks over building a full automated SQL-testing suite.
- Almost few thousand lines+ of SQL code and multiple-chained CTEs, complex weighted scoring, etc. - is for purely historical data sampling, so it made write only validation queries on the fly.
- SQL scripts run ONCE to create static dataset - so decision was to not dockerize one-time, non-operational scripts.
- Found it extremely challenging to code DuckDB SQL and polars, manage multiple scripting, research tasks at once.
